#csf_analyzer

This is a CLI tool to analyze wavefunction from ORCA (CASSCF, ICE-CI...). Capabilities:

-Parse the weights and occupations of state-avereged calculations in ORCA
-Classify different type of excitation after reading user defined orbital block to evaluate charge-transfer.
-Classify degrees of excitation with respect to a given reference (coming soon)
