# CSF Analyzer

This is a command-line tool to analyze wavefunctions from ORCA (CASSCF, ICE-CI...).

## Capabilities

* Parse the weights and occupations of state-averaged calculations in ORCA
* Classify different types of excitations after reading user-defined orbital blocks to evaluate charge transfer
* Classify degrees of excitation with respect to a given reference (coming soon)
